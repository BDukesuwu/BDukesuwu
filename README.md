### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**BDukesuwu/BDukesuwu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm currently working on **Anime WatchList**, a web application for tracking your favorite anime shows and movies. Itâ€™s a fun project that allows me to combine my love for anime with my coding skills!

Iâ€™m currently learning **Full-Stack Development** and diving into exciting technologies like **Node.js**, **React**, and **MongoDB**. Each new concept I learn opens up new possibilities, and Iâ€™m thrilled to explore them!

Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on projects that enhance user experiences and build interactive applications. Teamwork can bring so many creative ideas to life, and Iâ€™m always looking to connect with others who share this passion.

Iâ€™m seeking help with understanding advanced concepts in **JavaScript** and **React**. If you have any tips or resources, Iâ€™d be grateful for your guidance!

Feel free to ask me about my projects, UI/UX design, or any recommendations for anime showsâ€”I'm always excited to chat about them!

You can reach me at: [emi.uwaa@gmail.com](mailto:emi.uwaa@gmail.com). 

My pronouns are She/Her, and I love collecting anime figurines and exploring different genres of animeâ€”thereâ€™s always something new to discover! âš¡
